// Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a method of confirming a user's
// claimed identity in which a computer user is granted access only after
// successfully presenting two or more pieces of evidence (or factors) to an
// authentication mechanism: knowledge (something the user and only the user
// knows), possession (something the user and only the user has), and
// inherence (something the user and only the user is).
